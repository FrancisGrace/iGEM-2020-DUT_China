# iGEM-2020-DUT_China
The wiki pages we designed for a project focusing on synthetic biology.
Our winning project is **Reboot T4**. According to the concept of synthetic biology, it uses big genome of T4 to produce new synthetic phages through modular design, reassembly in yeast, and reactivation in Escherichia coli. This approach makes it possible to gene-edit or streamline the phage genome so that the “perfect” phage can be created without resource constraints.
