<section id="main-text">
    <p>
        We are a student team from Dalian University of technology. During the process of studying phages, we found that the domestic phage therapy has not been well developed yet while it has formed an industrial chain at abroad. Through research and interviews among specialists, we believe that phages  would and should be applied in internal medical treatment near future due to its advantages that antibiotics does not have. Thus, we suggest that the relevant laws of bacteriophage medicine should be improved as soon as possible in order to pave the way for the development and industrialization of phage therapy in China.
    </p>
    <article class="article">
        <h1>1 The urgent need to develop and improve the related laws and regulations</h1>
        <h2>1.1 The prospect of bacteriophages</h2>
        <p>
            Antibiotic therapy is the mainstream solution to the bacterial infection in China at present. However, with the increasing antibiotic resistance, we need another method to deal with superbacterias. Current studies have showed that bacteriophages can lyse host bacteria with high specificity and do not infect the body’s owe cell. This provides the possibility for phage therapy. Phage therapy has not been  used in clinical practice because of the existence of toxin gene with toxic effect, the narrow spectrum and bioethics, etc. But this problem can be solved through the follow-up research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phage therapy has begun to take shape at abroad. At current, Georgia, Poland, Russia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States and other countries devote great effort to phages to promote the application of phage therapy while many countries have legislated to ensure the proper use of phage therapy. In 2017, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) mentioned bacteriophage drugs will be considered in a regulatory approach similar to vaccines at a seminar on bacteriophage therapy mentioned that bacteriophage drugs would be considered to be included in the regulatory approach similar to vaccines, that is, to modify the phage composition of the product when necessary (such as when resistance occurs) without the need for clinical trial and declaration. Phage will become a legal bacterial drug that can rapidly evolve to respond to antibiotic resistance to the original drug recipe with advantages over traditional antibiotics if the regulation is established. Besides, FDA has provided green channels for phage drugs for clinical use in emergency situations. For example, in 2019, the first clinical trial of intravenous phage therapy in the US was approved by the FDA  while Phase 1 and 2 mainly evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of phages.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, EMA (European Medicines Agency) believes that any currently existing drug regulatory  are not suitable for phage therapy while it need a special one. In general, Europe is more open and optimistic about phage therapy. The European Union has funded a multinational center clinical research program for phage therapy (Phagoburn Project). Scientists in France, Belgium and the Netherlands also conducted clinical trials of phage therapy in burn patients infected with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In addition, we can see from EMA's Seminar on phage therapy application held in June 2015, EMA encourages drug developers and regulators to continue to work on how the regulatory framework supports and provides appropriate flexibility for upcoming phage tests and studies. All in all，the positive attitude these countries hold towards phage research also proves that phage therapy has the hope and potential to develop in China with an adequate medical system.
        </p>
        <h2>1.2 The domestic management and control of phage therapy in China</h2>
        <p>
            There are quite a number of companies in the field of phage or phage lyase (belonging to enzyme biopharmaceutical ) at abroad, due to the relatively clear regulatory path and open communication mechanism. These phage companies have a wide range of treatment study, including systemic infection, skin infection and gastrointestinal tract infection. In addition, these companies are very active in the field of cooperation and financing, and continue to attract the attention of investors and peer companies. In contras, the clinical trials of phage therapy have not been carried out yet in China because of the imperfect regulation of phage drugs. Only A few companies such as Phagelux, Dalian Hissen and Shanghai Hi-Tech-Bio are developing human phage therapy preparations. In this process of continuous. Among them, no company have disclose their progress except Phagelux.

    <article class="article">
        <h1>2 The urgent need for NPC Standing Committee to issue relevant laws and regulations on bacteriophage therapy</h1>
        <h2>2.1 The introduction of phage therapy related laws is in line with the short-term goal of the NPC Standing Committee.</h2>
        <p>
            According to the 2020 work report of the NPC Standing Committee (National People's Congress Standing Committe), affected by the epidemic situation, this year NPC Standing Committee will focus more on the field of public health. In particular, it will attach great importance to strengthening the legislation and revision of the law on legal protection of public health. For example, the basic medical and health promotion law, the vaccine management law and the drug administration law have been formulated. Bacteriophages, as a potential bacterial infection therapy in the next few decades, is an important aspect in strengthening public health.
        </p>
        <h2>2.2 The introduction of relevant laws on bacteriophage therapy is conducive to the standardization of the application of evidence rules in the arbitration and litigation stages of bacteriophage therapy related cases.</h2>
        <p>
            We think, the laws promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee can be applied to the whole country and can be used as the basis for the court to decide directly. We suggests that a special law for bacteriophage therapy should be established in China to avoid the loss of credibility of arbitration award or court award due to the inconsistency of arbitration and litigation award standards. Also, if laws and regulations are promulgated by other relevant departments, the order of application in law is lower than that promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee.
        </p>
        <h2>2.3 The law on phage therapy issued by the NPC Standing Committee can be more authoritative.</h2>
        <p>
            The NPC Standing Committee, as a permanent organ of the highest legislature in China, enjoys the highest legislative power. So the revised bill on phage therapy made by NPC Standing Committee can be applied nationwide, which will supply a gap of the law related to bacteriophages.

        <h1>3 Conception of the draft related to bacteriophage therapy</h1>
        <h2>3.1 Sorting out he existing laws</h2>
        <p>
            At present, there is a gap in laws related to bacteriophage pharmacy in China. We have collected the domestic and foreign laws and obtained some inspiration from the GMP(Good Manufacturing Practice) law issued by the EU. We have consulted experts at home and abroad who study in phage pharmaceutical and clinical, and their suggestions will serve as a supplement.
            Good Manufacturing Practice,
